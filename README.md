My iTerm2 profile settings.

In iTerm:
1. Go to Preferences->General. You will see the following at the bottom of the panel:

2. Check `Load preferences from a custom folder or URL:`
3. Browse for the folder where you want to save your custom profile. If you are like me and have Dropbox installed, save it to a Dropbox folder. This will allow you to have the exact same settings on different computers.
4. Check `Save changes to folder when iTerm2 quits`.
5. Click `Save Current Settings to Folder`.

And you're all set!
