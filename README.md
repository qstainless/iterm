iTerm2
-
My [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) profile settings.

To install the matrix theme, follow Step 2 of 3 of the instructions [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-a-badass-matrix-terminal-and-maybe-learn-something-about-code-8abc81c6b7a2).

To import my profile and make it your own (or whatever):
1. Go to Preferences->General. You will see the following at the bottom of the panel:

2. Check `Load preferences from a custom folder or URL:`
3. Browse for the folder where you want to save your custom profile. If you are like me and have Dropbox installed, save it to a Dropbox folder. This will allow you to have the exact same settings on different computers.
4. Check `Save changes to folder when iTerm2 quits`.
5. Click `Save Current Settings to Folder`.

And you're all set!
